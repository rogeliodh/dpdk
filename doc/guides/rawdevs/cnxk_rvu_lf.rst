Marvell CNXK RVU LF Driver
==========================

CNXK product families can have a use case to allow RVU PF and RVU VF
driver to communicate using mailboxes and also get notified
of any interrupt that may occur on the device.
Hence, a new raw device driver is added for such RVU LF devices.
These devices can map to a RVU PF or a RVU VF which
can send mailboxes to each other.

Limitations
-----------

In multi-process mode user-space application must ensure
no resources sharing takes place.
Otherwise, user-space application should ensure synchronization.

Device Setup
------------

The RVU LF devices will need to be bound to a user-space IO driver for use.
The script ``dpdk-devbind.py`` included with DPDK can be used to
view the state of the devices and to bind them to a suitable DPDK-supported
kernel driver. When querying the status of the devices, they will appear under
the category of "Misc (rawdev) devices", i.e. the command
``dpdk-devbind.py --status-dev misc`` can be used to see the state of those
devices alone.
